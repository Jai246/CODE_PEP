Respect Reduces Stress
Reducing stress is especially important for the health of employees in the workplace. Dear, stress-free employees feel more comfortable sharing ideas and working with colleagues to achieve their goals. Increased respect and reduced stress have both mental and physical effects on workers’ health.

Respect Increases Productivity and Collaboration
Respect helps employees to think innovatively and work hard as they know that their ideas would be appreciated. Such workplaces become an opportunity to learn from each other, where both employees and managers develop their skills. Once your employees start collaborating, cross-training and informal learning can be done across all areas of your company.

Employee Satisfaction
Employees can be happy with their work and leave at the end of the day feeling proud of what they’ve done. This sense of satisfaction from employees can benefit employers in the long run. Satisfied employees usually want to stay with companies that value them and are looking for ways to advance or develop their careers. Satisfied employees are more likely to apply for internal promotions and lead their teams with the same respect and care that they used to value. Lower employee turnover turns into less revenue and time spent on training and onboarding.

Respect Creates a Fair Environment
One of the most important things an employer can offer is the opportunity for employees to showcase their skills and knowledge regardless of their background. Respect prevents people from playing favorites, and everyone has a chance to be heard. A Good Chance is a powerful tool for enabling different employees to participate. Every employee has the same voice as his colleagues, and all ideas are appreciated, no matter where they come from. In the right environment, employees can thrive if allowed to contribute equitably.
